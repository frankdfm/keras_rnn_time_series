# keras_rnn_time_series

This project tries to compare the performance among MLP, SimpleRNN, LSTM on predicting univariate time series data.

Architecture are all very simple - 20 units of neurons as hidden, 1 unit of fully connected as output.

Feature is origin time series data point, label is smoothed data point given.
